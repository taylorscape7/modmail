# v2.0.3

Fixed some issues with how data is displayed in the info embed.

### Fixed

    - Before this patch, anyone could use the logs commands.

# v2.0.0

This release introduces the use of our centralized [API service](https://github.com/kyb3r/webserver) to enable dynamic configuration, auto-updates, and thread logs. To use this release you must acquire an API token from https://modmail.tk. Read the updated installation guide [here](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/installation).

### Changed
- Stability improvements through synchronization primitives 
- Refactor thread management and code
- Update command now uses `api.modmail.tk` 
- Removed `archive` command
    - Explanation: With thread logs (that lasts forever), there's no point in archiving.
- `contact` command no longer tells the user you messaged them ðŸ‘» 

### Fixed
